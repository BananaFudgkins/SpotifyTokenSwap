Spotify Token Swap Service for Heroku
=======

To use the new [Spotify SDK](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk) we are required to run our own [Token Exchange Service](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/tutorial/#setting-up-your-token-exchange-service). This repository provides you with an easy installation on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/home).


Setup
=======

* Sign up for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)

Unless you are expecting **massive** traffic, the free plan will work for you.

* Check out this Repository




Convenience
=======

I personally will host an instance on Heroku for public use as it is very annoying to go through setting everything up when you just want to try something with the SDK. I'll keep it on the free plan and will use it in my own app. We'll see how it goes but if the service it getting slammed I'll probably shut it down.
