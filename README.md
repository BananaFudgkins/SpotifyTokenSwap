Spotify Token Swap Service for Heroku
=======

To use the new [Spotify SDK](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk) we are required to run our own [Token Exchange Service](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/tutorial/#setting-up-your-token-exchange-service). This repository provides you with an easy installation on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/home).


# Setup

* Sign up for [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)

Unless you are expecting **massive** traffic, the free plan will work for you.
